# Scholarship-Application
System including real world production ready automation for scholarship follow-up
Colleges process hundreds of Mahadbt scholarship applications each year using manual methods like registers and Excel. This causes tracking errors, delayed verification, missed deadlines, and repeated follow-ups. Students lack reminders, staff face inefficiency, and there is no centralized, transparent system to monitor application status.
